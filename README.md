# Visualising Vowel Space Change with GAMMs

This tutorial post is currently hosted at 
<https://joshua.wilsonblack.nz/post/visualising-vowel-space-gamms/>.

This repository is to enable submission to the 
[Linguistics Methods Hub](https://lingmethodshub.github.io).

The tutorial covers: 

1. The use of `purrr` to fit multiple models with the same
structure, which capture changes in the position of monophthongs in the 
vowel space over time, and
2. The use of `ggplot2` and `gganimate` to plot the predictions of these models
within the vowel space.

The data is available as `anon_ONZE_mean_sample.rds`. The tutorial is found in
`index.Rmd`.
